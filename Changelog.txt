*2.19b 5/23/2013
** Some editors show a * in the window title if the file is edited, which was clearing the current word. I have changed the title comparison to filter out *, -, and space characters. Please let me know if any additional characters should be added.

*2.19 5/22/2013
** A new preference, SuppressMatchingWord, has been added to suppress any words from the wordlist which match the current word. This is case-sensitive if NoBackspace=Off, otherwise it's case in-sensitive.

** Fixed a bug where some Learned Words could be removed if someone had manually added duplicates to the Learned Word list.

** Reduced the flashing of the icon when switching programs.
** Added an option to automatically add a space to the end of a word (Default is OFF).

** Word is not cleared if you type in a non-enabled window, then switch back to the previous caret position in the last enabled window.
** Changed HelperWindow to +Owner, not +ToolWindow (slightly changes appearance).

*2.10 02/26/2010

** Hotkeys are now suspended when loading and saving the wordlist. This lets hotkeys be typed while loading/saving and also shows an S rather than an H in the icon when the script is loading/saving.
** Fixed a bug introduced with 2.04 which made it so the tooltip didn't go away after changing windows.
